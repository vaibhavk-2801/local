## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a **practical demonstration of Version Control and CI/CD basics**. While the visual component is a styled button interface, the primary objective of this project was to master the professional GitHub workflow, including:

* Initializing local repositories.
* Managing remote origins and upstream branches.
* Executing commit/push workflows via Command Line Interface (CLI).
* Deploying static assets using **GitHub Pages**.

## 🌟 Key Learnings Implemented
* **Version Control:** Git command mastery (`init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `remote`).
* **Remote Management:** resolving `remote origin already exists` conflicts.
* **Frontend Basics:** Clean HTML5 structure with CSS3 styling.
* **Deployment:** Live hosting configuration via GitHub infrastructure.
